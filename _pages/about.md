# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I am currently a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Key Laboratory of Robotic Perception and Intelligence, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working with [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiankunwang.html) and [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~qhmeng/about.html).I will embark on my Ph.D. studies at SUSTech this fall, co-advised by [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiankunwang.html) and [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/authors/hong_zhang/). 

Previously, I served as a Research Assistant at the Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), working with [Prof. Houde Dai](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~dhd?language=en). I obtained my B.Eng. in Automation from Huaqiao University in 2020. In the same year, I was admitted through the exemption program to the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), with my graduate training conducted at the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, CAS. I received my M.Eng. in Control Engineering in 2023.

My research focuses on robotics, specifically in the areas of planning, control, and social awareness for human-following robots. I am currently dedicated to developing user-aware control strategies that enable robots to follow or accompany users while respecting their social space. My ultimate goal is to create a socially-aware Robot Person Following system that adheres to social norms and demonstrates reliable intelligence in assisting humans.
