# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), co-advised by [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiankunwang.html) and [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=zhangh33&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en). My research focuses on robotics, specifically planning, control, and reinforcement learning for robot person following (RPF). My long-term goal is to develop a socially-aware RPF system that adheres to social norms while demonstrating robust assistive intelligence.

Previously, I served as a research and teaching assistant at the Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotic Perception and Intelligence, SUSTech (2025), working with [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiankunwang.html) and [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/mengqinghu.html). Earlier in 2024, I was a research assistant at the [Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing](http://english.fjirsm.cas.cn/et/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), working with [Prof. Houde Dai](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~dhd?language=en). 

 I obtained my B.Eng. in Automation from [Huaqiao University](https://en.hqu.edu.cn/) in 2020. That same year, I was admitted via merit-based exemption to the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), where I pursued graduate studies at the [Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter](http://english.fjirsm.cas.cn/et/), CAS. I received my M.Eng. in Control Engineering in 2023.
