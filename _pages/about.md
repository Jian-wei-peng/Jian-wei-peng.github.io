# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I am a Research Assistant at the Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Houde Dai](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~dhd?language=en). My research focuses on developing human-following control algorithms for mobile robots to perform collaborative tasks in the human-robot coexistence environment.

Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Automation from Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China, in 2020 as an outstanding graduate. In the same year, I secured direct admission to the graduate programme of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the academic training unit is the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2023, I received my M.S. degree in Control Engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

**[A Dual Closed-Loop Control Strategy for Human-Following Robots Respecting Social Space](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10611263)**

In this paper, we propose a dual closed-loop human-following control strategy that combines model predictive control (MPC) and impedance control. The outer-loop MPC ensures precise control of the robot‚Äôs posture while tracking the target person‚Äôs velocity and direction to coordinate the motion between them. The inner-loop impedance controller is employed to regulate the robot‚Äôs motion and interaction force with the target person, enabling the robot to maintain a respectful and comfortable distance from the target person. Concretely, the social interaction dynamics characteristics between the robot and the target person are described by human-robot interaction dynamics, which considers the rules of social space. Furthermore, an obstacle avoidance component constructed using behavioral dynamics is integrated into the impedance controller.

**[MPC-Based Human-Accompanying Control Strategy for Improving the Motion Coordination Between the Target Person and the Robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10342246)**

 In this paper, we propose a human-accompanying control strategy to improve the motion coordination for better practicability of the human-accompanying robot. Our approach allows the robot to adapt to the motion variations of the target person and avoid obstacles while accompanying them. First, a human-robot interaction model based on the separation-bearing-orientation scheme is developed to ascertain the relative position and orientation between the robot and the target person. Then, a human-accompanying controller based on behavioral dynamics and model predictive control (MPC) is designed to avoid obstacles and simultaneously track the direction and velocity of the target person.
